#+TITLE: org-weights â€” Show how heavy Org subtrees are

Display the weights for every Org header which was visible at the time
the mode was activated.  The weights of a header are the counts of
sub-trees and paragraphs for the the sub-tree starting with that header.
Paragraphs include items and other equivalent structures.

While this code is fast enough for my needs, it uses a bit of
quadratic time for headers scanning, so it might become slow if there
were a big number of headers.

[2013-02-17 dim] A few times already, I spoke on the Org mailing list
of my need to see the weights of sub-trees on header lines.  Nicolas
Goaziou was kind enough to write the function for computing the
weights, I wrapped some Lisp code around this, and shared the result
on the list.  In that code, I had a command which computes and
displays the weights, and as soon as I modify the buffer, the weights
were disappearing.

I recently had the need to frequently re-evaluate the weights after
modifications, and got tired of repeating the displaying command after
each modification.  So I adapted the code so the weights get updated
instead of disappearing.  Bastien also suggested that I turn my code
into a small library, so here it is.  It works relatively OK for me.
Bugs surely remain. :-)
